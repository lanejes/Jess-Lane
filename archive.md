# **Architecture Principles for Justice**
Guiding an effective and efficient architecture for the justice system
Scope
These principles focus on the delivery or selection of software systems managing the information of the justice system, including:

* Citizen-facing online services
* Staff-facing services
* Platforms which support services
* Data systems

But excluding:

* General-purpose productivity tools
* Native commercial software applications
* End user devices
* Networks

Initially we will focus on using the principles within the Ministry of Justice.

Architecture is often about trade-offs and compromises, to ensure delivery is possible. Therefore, none of these principles should be considered ‘unbreakable’. Where they cannot be followed, there should be well-reasoned explanations for the tactical approach.

For practical reasons, these principles do not apply retrospectively. It is not useful to say that a legacy system does not meet the principles. However, the principles will help us understand which remediation work to legacy systems is ‘tactical’ or ‘strategic’.
